<section id="about-me" class="about-me">
   <h2 class="head">Salutations. I'm Christian. Pleasure to meet you!</h2>
        <p>
            I am a full-stack developer, writer, editor with a background in content creation and marketing.
            I recently earned my certificate in Full Stack Development from the University of California, Riverside Extension program 
            with newly developed skills in HTML, CSS, and Javascript. <br>

            An adaptable and innovative problem solver that's passionate in developing unique user experiences. My degree in English and Creative Writing
            along with my background in content creation has prepared me to approach problems with creativity and teamwork.<br>

            Every project I approach, I aim to simple and effective code that meets the highest of standards. Recently, I've
            applied aspects of UX and agile development within a team of four to develop an interactive learning app that can help anyone learn a new skill.<br>

            When I'm not developing, I'm either writing my newest story, hiking, trying out a new recipe, or working on the newest vide game with the indie developer, Aphelops.<br>

            I'm excited to leverage my skills, both new and refined with an ethical, fast-paced, quality-driven team.<br> 
            But don't take my word for it: <i>please take a look around!</i>
        </p>
