# homework-2

## Description

I wanted to create a portfolio that showcased and reflected what I have learned in this class that's intended to be ever-evolving and changing in order to reflect my ever-increasing experience.
Right now, it displays my first homework assignment, the Refractoring Website "Horiseon," with additional slots to add future assignments and projects.My intention is to turn this homework assignment into a professional portfolio, and although I am proud of the work that I have created, I know I still have a long way to go.
I feel like I finally understand the concept of flex and flexbox, and I learned how to use "@media query." However, I still have a long way to go before it becomes second nature to me. Nevertheless, this is my portfolio, one that will change over time.
